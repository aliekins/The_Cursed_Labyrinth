Explore three biomes of a dungeon you have found yourself trapped in. In each biome, find and solve the special puzzle, then advance further.\hypertarget{index_controls}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Controls}{Controls}}\label{index_controls}

Hearts = your HP. The bar contains 10 hearts(each representing 10 \% of your health). Different elements of the dungeon may damage or heal your HP.\hypertarget{index_items}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Items}{Items}}\label{index_items}
You can expect swords, potions, enchantment books and lastly cursed items. Rest assured, the inventory will store most of them for you.\hypertarget{index_puzzles}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Puzzles}{Puzzles}}\label{index_puzzles}
Not to worry, these puzzles are no rocket science.\+Each biome contains one, which you must solve. When the puzzle is solved, the biomeâ€™s exit point will let you through(if you find it of course).\hypertarget{index_hints}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Hints}{Hints}}\label{index_hints}
You will see the ghost of the slain beast appear in different forms at doors or inside rooms. ~\newline
 He will not harm you, just give you a hint and disappear.\hypertarget{index_death_refresh}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Death and Refresh}{Death and Refresh}}\label{index_death_refresh}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Death (HP = 0)\+: The game restarts from the beginning (Biome 0).
\item Refresh\+: Restarts only the current biome. Your inventory is restored to the one you had when you entered this biome.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_tips}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Tips}{Tips}}\label{index_tips}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If E/Q does not do anything, step a little closer to the object and try again.
\item If you drop an item and it seems lost, check around the dungeon again. Items important to solve the puzzle respawn when dropped at a wrong place.
\item Do not try to tank traps, they are not your friends.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Have fun, explore carefully, and follow the ghost! ðŸ‘»
