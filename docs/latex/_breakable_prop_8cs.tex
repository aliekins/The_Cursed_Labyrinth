\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Breakable prop that drops items; cursed drops integrate with respawn. 

Press E near the prop to break it. If the player is close enough, items can be auto-\/picked up; otherwise a \doxylink{class_pickup_item}{Pickup\+Item} is spawned at this position (cursed ones are registered with the \doxylink{class_cursed_item_respawn_manager}{Cursed\+Item\+Respawn\+Manager}).
