This guide tries not to spoil the main steps to end the game. However, if you do not have time to explore on your own, check this document [here](./Spoilers.md) for spoilers.

## Goal
Explore three biomes of a dungeon you have found yourself trapped in. In each biome, find and solve the special puzzle, then advance further.

## Controls
- Move: WASD / Arrow Keys
- Interact / Pick Up / Use: E
- Place Down: Q
- Heal: H
- Refresh: R

## Health
Hearts = your HP.
The bar contains 10 hearts (each representing 10% of your health).
Different elements of the dungeon may damage or heal your HP.

## Items
You can expect swords, potions, enchantment books and lastly cursed items.
Rest assured, the inventory will store most of them for you.

## Puzzles
Not to worry, these puzzles are no rocket science. Each biome contains one, which you must solve.
When the puzzle is solved, biomeâ€™s exit point will let you through (if you find it of course).

## Hints
You will see the ghost of the slain beast appear in different forms at doors or inside rooms. He will not harm you, just give you a hint and disappear.

## Death and Refresh
Death (HP = 0): The game restarts from the beginning (Biome 0).
Refresh: Restarts only the current biome. Your inventory is restored to the one you had when you entered this biome.

## Tips
If E/Q does not do anything, step a little closer to the object and try again.
If you drop an item and it seems lost, check around the dungeon again. Items important to solve the puzzle respawn when dropped at a wrong place.
Do not try to tank traps, they are not your friends.

Have fun, explore carefully, and follow the ghost! ðŸ‘»
