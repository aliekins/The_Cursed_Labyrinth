        you know.. I am not the only one guarding this beautiful home. I would not
        forget to take the sword with me, if I were you... You never know when it
        might come in handy

      text: You've grown on me you know, but I would still like to see you gone from
        this place... Let me give you a small advice - these rooms are CURSED. I
        would not stay here too long, if I were you..
