@section health Health
Hearts = your HP.
The bar contains 10 hearts(each representing 10 % of your health).
Different elements of the dungeon may damage or heal your HP.

@section items Items
You can expect swords, potions, enchantment books and lastly cursed items.
Rest assured, the inventory will store most of them for you.

@section puzzles Puzzles
Not to worry, these puzzles are no rocket science.Each biome contains one, which you must solve.
When the puzzle is solved, the biome’s exit point will let you through(if you find it of course).

@section hints Hints
You will see the ghost of the slain beast appear in different forms at doors or inside rooms.  
He will not harm you, just give you a hint and disappear.

@section death_refresh Death and Refresh
- **Death (HP = 0):**The game restarts from the beginning (Biome 0).
- **Refresh:**Restarts only the current biome. Your inventory is restored to the one you had when you entered this biome.

@section tips Tips
- If E/Q does not do anything, step a little closer to the object and try again.
- If you drop an item and it seems lost, check around the dungeon again. Items important to solve the puzzle respawn when dropped at a wrong place.
- Do not try to tank traps, they are not your friends.

Have fun, explore carefully, and follow the ghost! 👻
